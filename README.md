# Assignment: One HTML and CSS

For this assignment, you will clone Dr. John Monberg's wra410 repository.

You will update your README.md file so that I can learn about the changes you made.

If I can't find your changes, I can't give you credit for them

Revise the following section in your README.md file with a short description of what you've accomplished.

## Required Changes to WRA 410

1. Make changes to the background color of a page and a div.

    -I edited the background color of all pages and of the container div to a dark grey, which
    is similar to "night mode" on many applications.  I also modified the footer color to fit better with the theme.
    Another change that I made was to the schedule colors, they have been modified to be consistent with the rest
    of the site.  Changes were also made to the student groups page.

2. Use a new font.

    -I changed the font to Georgia and changed the color to white so it would be easy to read
    on the dark background.

3. Include two images.

    -I added the MSU spartan head logo to the homepage under the menu and to the left of the content.
    I added a meme about coding in the same place on the resources page.
    Both of these files were places in an images folder.

4. Use a table to format the Grading Scale on the Assignments page.

5. Reformat the Student Groups. Use a different color for links, add a title for each group, seperate each student. Use multiple columns for the divs.  

6. Add navgation to the Schedule webpage.

7. Revise the rows and columns on the Schedule webpage so the information is clearer or prettier.
